# Asyncio PriorityQueue

Simple producer/consumer use case for [asyncio.PriorityQueue](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-queue.html)

See `scripts/priority-queue.sh` for a reasonable sets of input arguments.

The code is also available in public [gist](https://gist.github.com/codcod/61e7dfb13a0c26533f0a6631d6557e52).
